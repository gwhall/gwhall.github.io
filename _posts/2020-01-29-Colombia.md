 INTRO<br>
 In January 2020, I fortunately had enough time during a friends' trip to carve out two visits to two distinctly different coffee farms. Both farms lay a pleasant drive away from the cities of Bogota and Medellin, respectively.<br>
 I began with a visit to  <a href="http://www.lapalmayeltucan.com/">La Palma y El Tucan.</a> Felipe and Elisa Sardi run this small-scale, quality-driven operation. Ecotourism and sustainability are values at the forefront of their mentality. During my 4 hour visit, I saw about 20 guests, who seemed to genuinely hold peaceful smiles and excitement for the coffee.
