 INTRO In January 2020, I fortunately had enough time during a friends' trip to carve out two visits to two distinctly different coffee farms. Both farms lay a pleasant mountain drive away from the cities of Bogota and Medellin, respectively.(PHOTOS OF CITIES) <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Acatenango/@14.5004601,-90.8931758,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x858917a5046cfc49:0x2d5b1ab999738383!8m2!3d14.500461!4d-90.8756662">Acatenango Region</a> of Guatemala for five weeks. Felipe and Elisa Sardi run La Palma y El Tucan, which is a small-scale, quality-driven operation. Ecotourism and sustainability are values at the forefront of their mentality. I saw about 20 guests, who seemed to genuinely hold peaceful smiles and excitement for the coffee.  tost-harvest fermentation phase of coffee processing. <br><br>Check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10OmdlqpI6QcsKb0eghdLRNhbtJphvzDi3jFjCQ5syw4/edit?usp=sharing">data</a>! <br>(Underlined words are hyperlinks, so click on them! )<br>These data were recorded in Spanish, so let me know if you need a translation.

The five weeks gave me much to write about, but for you Tl;Dr types- here is what I learned in a nutshell. <br><br>

1. Most coffee people here are aware that climate change is threatening production. Managers realize they must adjust their practices, and this includes incorporating scientific research and methods. Yet, the lack of formal education and resources (both human labor and material) makes it challenging to perform true scientific experiments in this setting.  
<br><br>2. Coffee is processed by only a handful of people who work long hours for 5 or 6 days a week at the mill. 
<br><br>3. Workers usually don’t get to consume the coffee that they process, because it is too expensive. They mostly drink Nescafe. 
<br><br><br>

Ok, you want to learn more? 
<br>I just ask you remember one key thing: 
<br><br>
1. Fermentation is a strictly <b>anaerobic</b> process. <br><img src="https://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/alcferm.gif" alt="metabolism"><br> There is no such thing as aerobic fermentation. The misuse of the word fermentation is rampant in the coffee world and incorrectly suggests we actually know what is happening during this phase. In reality, we only know that there is an entire suite of microbial metabolisms occurring. Some of these require oxygen, and others don’t. The details remain mostly unknown. <br>I believe that characterization of the microbiota will become essential knowledge if coffee producers truly wish to control and improve their wet processing method, and overall be resilient to changing environmental conditions. 
<br><br>	
Since I want to keep this focused as much as possible on my experience (aka less like a textbook), here are useful links to background info. Study up.

<br><br><br><br>

Making these modern adjustments will be difficult for some, because coffee producers have always relied upon traditional methods to grow and process their product. Yet, some producers are early adopters of simple but quantitative methods in the hopes of producing a more consistent product. The most savvy people often draw influence from wine production methods, which are pretty effective in controlling post-harvest conditions. The coffee fermentation step is becoming especially scrutinized. A certain company sells specific yeast strains that can be added to a batch to help homogenize the fermentation product. <br>Before I arrived, my bosses bought some, but were unsure how to best use it. This is where I came in- I was asked to come to specifically test how under what conditions the yeast works best to reduce fermentation time and/or improve coffee quality. 
<br>I am by no means a fermentation expert, but I have decent knowledge of plant/microbiology and experimental design. I was honored to be asked to come work in Guatemala, but was slightly nervous that I was underqualified. 

<br>I arrived in Guatemala at night with two backpacks, and a mixture of nerves and excitement.

<b>11/14-11/16</b>
<br>I spent the first three days learning how coffee is wet processed here.<br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Panoramic of mill.jpg"><br>The general process goes like this: <br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/IMG_0684.jpg"> 
<br>
<br>Every mill has its own quirks. Here, days go like this;  
<br>1. Coffee fruit picked throughout the day by entire families.<br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Full truck.jpg">They and their harvest arrive at the mill in dump trucks between 3 and 7 pm. <br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/IMG_0376.jpg"> <br><center>Mature fruit</center><br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Delivery truck.jpg">
<br>2. Families weigh their bags by the “quintal” (100 lbs.)<br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Weighing quintales.jpg"> <br> This data is recorded by a mill administrator and used to determine payment, which occur every 15 days. 
<br><br>3. Fruit is dumped into giant tanks of clean water. <br><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1aENZz_R_k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br> Here, the first separation of quality occurs. Any “floaters” (over-ripe or otherwise defected fruit, usually due to pest infestation or disease) are scraped off, depulped, and sent to concrete fermentation tanks. 
<br>All pulp is sent through PVC tubes to a truck outside the mill. The pulp will be sent to nurseries for use as compost. <br> <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Pulp truck.jpg"><br> 
<br><br>4. The remaining, higher-quality (more dense) coffee is washed out of the tanks, to machines called “cribas” that classify beans based on size. The ranking goes 1A (largest), then 1B, 2, and 1C (smallest). I never found out why 1C isn’t before 2…<br>
Cribas are rotating cylinders with holes that allow only beans under a certain size to pass through. In the first criba, 1A cannot pass because it is too large. Any remaining whole fruit is passed through a depulper, which uses pressure to separate the bean from its pulp. These beans pass through yet another 1A criba (a backup), then rejoin the other 1A beans in their own channel. These are are sent to the 1A fermentation tanks.<br>Keep in mind that fruit arrives in various stages of maturation. Extremely mature fruit has already been depulped, so some beans are already free. These fall to the bottom of the channels as they pass, and are directed through the a series of pipes of a Canyon Colorado (shown below). This nifty system effectively separates free beans from pulp, with the help of gravity. Pulp floats while beans sink. 
<br><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijnEld1fMJo" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<br>5. The rest of non-1A beans pass through a second criba that selects for 1B. The process goes the same as for 1A, just with cribas adjusted for smaller bean size. 
<br>6. The same process is repeated, for 2,1C (the smallest seed classification), and Nata (the bunk stuff… aka future Nescafe)<br><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p3ociwgKkDE" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<br>7. Beans are fermented in open concrete tanks.<br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Fermentation tank with Mario.jpg"><br>They definitely are not sterile, but they do the job.<br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Dirty tank.jpg"><br><center>Algal growth and a drain</center>
<br>8.After fermentation, beans then washed to remove mucilage. <br><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_0Src98NeQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br>They look like this after washing. <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/After wash.jpg">
<br>9. Washed beans are placed out to dry, either directly on the patio, or in wooden boxes with metal screen bottoms. <br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Drying box.jpg"><br>Either way, someone needs to periodically mix the drying beans to homogenize the product. Here, it's Jose Juan.<br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Dry box with JJ.jpg"><br>After about a week, once the moisture content reaches about 11%, beans are bagged and sent to the on-site bodega for storage until pick up. <br><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/IMG_0424.jpg"><center>The bean bodega</center>
