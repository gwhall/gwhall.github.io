Hi there! I'm Griffin. I am by no means a fermentation expert- I come from the central coast of California, and have spent the past six years in Davis, CA earning my Bachelors in Biology, then assisting to begin and manage the ecology lab of Dr. Rachel Vannette. Here is her  (<a href="http://vannettelab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">research</a>. This gave me a solid idea of how to set up and perform scientific experiments. I was honored to be asked to come work in Guatemala- I hope this experience will help me get a coffee research job!
