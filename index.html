<h1>Hello! This is Griffin's Website</h1>

<body>
 In mid November 2017, I went to the Acatenango Region of Guatemala for five weeks to perform experiments in the wet mill to improve the fermentation phase of coffee processing. I lived in a nice finca house only a few kilometers from the bases of the Acatenango (dormant) and Fuego (active) volcanos. (insert volcano photos)
<br><br>
A lot happened in five weeks, but for you Tl:Dr types- here is what I learned in a nutshell. <br><br>

1. Most coffee people here are aware that climate change threatens coffee production. Managers realize that they must learn to adjust their practices, and this includes incorporating scientific research and methods. Yet, the lack of formal education and resources (both human labor and material) makes doing real scientific experiments nearly impossible in the field.  
<br>2. Very few people work very long hours for 5 or 6 days a week at the mill. 
<br>3. The producers of coffee often don’t get to consume the coffee that they process.
<br><br><br>

Ok, you want to learn more? 
<br><br>
I just ask you remember one key thing: 
<br><br>
1. Fermentation is a strictly anaerobic process (insert photo of metabolism). There is no such thing as aerobic fermentation. The misuse of the word fermentation is rampant in the coffee world and incorrectly suggests we actually know what is happening during this phase.  In reality, we only know that there is an entire suite of microbial metabolisms occurring (Some require oxygen, others no). The details remain mostly unknown. I believe that characterization of the microbiota will become essential knowledge if coffee producers truly wish to control and improve their wet processing method, and overall be resilient to change. 
<br><br>	
Since I want to keep this focused as much as possible on my experience (aka less textbook-y), here is a link to useful background information to know. (insert hyperlinks)
<br>-	Coffee fruit anatomy 
<br>-	Coffee fruit’s fate after picking (wet or dry method processes)
<br>-	Details of the wet processing method
<br>-	Why “fermentation” is used (to convert the mucilage from insoluble to soluble substance). 
<br><br><br><br>

Coffee producers have always relied upon traditional methods to grow and process, which are mostly unscientific. For example, take the “stick test” (insert video of JJ). However, producers (often influenced by wine production methods) are becoming more interested in controlling conditions, and incorporating scientific techniques. The fermentation step is becoming scrutinized more, and people want to know how to manipulate it better. One company sells yeast that you can add to the batch to help homogenize the fermentation product. My bosses bought some, but didn’t know how to best use it. This is where I come in- I was asked to come to specifically test how under what conditions the yeast works best to reduce fermentation time and/or improve coffee quality. 

I am by no means a fermentation expert- I come from the central coast of California, and have spent the past six years in Davis, CA earning my Bachelors in Biology, then assisting to begin and manage the ecology lab of Dr. Rachel Vannette. Here is her research (insert hyperlink to lab website). This gave me a solid idea of how to set up and perform scientific experiments. I was honored to be asked to come work in Guatemala- I hope this experience will help me get a coffee research job!

I arrived in Guatemala with my USA work mentality. I was in for a bit of a rude awakening- I quickly learned it was going to be impossible to perform science in the proper way I had been trained (oh no!). Lack of resources (both human and material) left no possibility for replication, and experiments could only be of the simplest kind that nearly anyone could understand. 75% of all Guatemalans can read, and only 5% get to attend university. And mind that I was in a rural area. My work had to be arranged keeping absolute practicality in mind- the goals are to make better coffee and earn the producers more money. 
<br><br>
11/14-11/16
<br>I spent the first three days learning how coffee is wet processed. The general process goes like this:, “fermentation” in concrete tank between 12-48 hours, submersion in water for 12 hours to remove mucilage, washing, drying in patio and subsequently in revolving dryers. Beans are then bagged and remain in “bodega” until they are trucked to a dry processing mill, where the parchment (“cascarillo”) will be removed from the inner “café de oro”. This “oro” is what is exported and enjoyed. 
<br>
<br>Each operation is unique. Here, days go like this;  
<br>1. Coffee fruit picked throughout the day by entire families arrives by truck between 3 and 7 pm.  
<br>2. Families weigh their bags by the “quintal” (100 lbs.). This data is recorded by El Colocho and used to determine payment, which occur every 15 days. 
<br>3. Fruit is dumped into giant tanks of water. Here, the first separation of quality occurs. Any “floaters” (over-ripe or otherwise defected fruit (due to pest infestation or disease) are scraped off, are depulped and sent to concrete fermentation tanks. 
<br>	- All pulp is sent through PVC tubes to a truck outside the mill. The pulp will be sent to nurseries for use as compost. 
<br>4. The remaining, higher-quality (more dense) coffee is washed out of the tanks, to machines called “cribas” classify coffee based on size.
Largest=1A, then 1B, 2, and 1C (smallest)
Each criba has holes that allow seeds under a certain size to pass. In the first criba, 1A cannot pass, and is sent though channels. Extremely mature fruit has already been depulped, and so some pergaminos are already free. These fall to the bottom of the channels as the pass, and are directed through the a series of pipes of a canyon Colorado. The holes in this criba again allow 1A pergaminos to pass and fall into the 1A fermentation tank, but not fruit. Remaining intact fruit is passed through a depulper, uses pressure to separate pulp from pergamino. These pergaminos pass through yet another criba (another backup), then into the same 1A fermentation tank. 
<br>5. Now, the rest of the smaller fruit that didn’t make it through the first 1A passes through a second criba for 1B. The process goes the same as for 1A, just with cribas adjusted for smaller pergaminos. 
<br>6. The same process is repeated, for 2, and 1C, which is the smallest seed. 
<br><br>
Three dump trucks arrive each evening. Every time, multiple tons of coffee are processed. Yet, this is accomplished by a very few number of employees. The average worker seems to arrive around 6:30 am, and some do not leave until 8 or 9 pm (if there is no problem/ delay…which there often are).

The Team (left to right) 
<br>Jairo Sigüil, Wilfido Galindo, Alberto Wiwi, Hilario Jimón, Don Layo, Griffin Hall (the only english speaker), José Juan Alvarez, Derick Xía, Eliseo Calléjas, Juan Cos, Warner Cos, Francisco Pérez (El colocho)
<br><br>
I didn’t get to interact with all, but here are mini bios of some. 
<br>1. El Colocho
<br>	Records harvest weight, and uses a portable refractometer (Brix) to record sugar content of the fruit. Normally, mature coffee has between 18-21% sugar. El colocho doesn’t have an email address, but he does have a cell phone. He has been working at the mill for 44 years, since he was 13. Back then, he was paid 50 cents a day. 
<br>
<br>2. Hilario and Hilario (aka Tomas)
<br>	This father-son duo is the heart of the mill. They are involved in the entire process. They use sticks to direct the coffee from the initial tank to the siphons, turn on/off all machines, and oversee that the entire process runs smoothly. 
Hilario (father) mostly oversees the “1A” process. He also washes coffee in the morning after fementation, and knows how to fix many of the machines. 
Hilario (son) is mostly responsible for overseeing the classifications (1B,2,1C,Nata)
<br><br>	
3. Wilfredo
<br>	Drying master. He monitors post- wash pergaminos until seeds contain humidity ~10%, which can then be sent to a dry mill for further processing. 
<br><br>	
4. Juan (did not appear in the group photo)
<br>Walks ~6 km to/from work each day. Has been doing this for decades. 
<br><br>

Despite the reliable efforts of these diligent workers and the many harvesters, producing quality coffee is always challenging and uncertain. One of the first things my boss told me was that climate change affects them in a big way. Weather is becoming more variable here, including more frequent severe weather that can damage/ remove cherries from branches, wash away soil from roots, and spread disease. Hectares of prime farmland are disappearing, and you can only plant so high on a mountain until you are at the top. In 2011, this company was hit hard with a “Roya” (coffee leaf rust) outbreak that reduced production by 75% of their previous year’s production. They still are below prior production levels.

<br>Work begins tonight after depulping! I’m excited and probably look like some starry-eyed idealistic millennial, full of hope. We began the basic experiment comparing the Lalcafe Cima® yeast (aka some undisclosed strain of S. cerevisiae) vs. a control. We took various measurements for all experiements- see the data sheet at the top of the page complete disclosure. 
At night, I tried to do some some internet research to find which factors could affect fermentation. I immediately missed having connection to a university internet- I could only read paper summaries (called Abstracts). ☹ 


<br><br>11/21/17
<br>Ok, today will be an expanded version of yesterday’s experiment. 
For each experiment, we used 10 kg of pergamino in each big blue bucket. Instead of the stick method, we used pH strips to determine when to terminate. (about pH 4). 

Over the weekend, I met a very small producer in San Miguel, at Lake Atitlán. He told me a tale of the MoscaMed program. (insert hyperlink to official site). He had no doubt that the program is a conspiracy, created by México to purposefully spread the Roya in Guatemala to relatively elevate their own industry. 
When I asked my boss, he immediately denounced that claim, saying the fly doesn’t do much to spread the roya. 
The Roya is no joke. There are ~90 varieties of the Roya, and it often mutates after each fungicide application. Boss believes there may be a cure, but the fungicide industry won’t let it out… hmm…

<br><br>11/22/17
<br>My USA work mentality doesn’t jive with a more lax culture of workers who aren’t accustomed to being totally precise. I find myself frustrated, feeling like I am the only one who has any idea what to do. People don’t understand why washing a treatment and control batch at different times would be problematic. Likewise for following strict hour schedules. I feel silly being frustrated/ kind of stressed amongst these happy and relaxed people. Ok, I just have to roll with it- this is the third world. This is what third world experimentation looks and feels like…still, onto more experiments. 
Today I became really curious about flies. Flies! The hidden answer. When I tap the bucket, dozens arise. More appear from the yeast bucket. Do they eat the yeast? Could this reduce microbial growth and therefore slow fementation? I’m privately nerding out.. 


<br><br>11/22/17
<br>Hm, seems that the results show that the bucket with more flies arrived at its wash point more quickly. Maybe the flies somehow accelerate growth? I don’t have access to any fine mesh net to exclude them, so my only option is to cover the bucket with a thick black plastic sheet. This will, of course, also greatly reduce oxygen access, but I am too curious to not do it. We began the covered vs. open experiment later that evening. 
I have another theory about the flies. Perhaps a higher sugar concentration -> faster ferm.. Having more sugar definitely attracts flies, so maybe this this also speeds up ferm…or maybe there is no effect? I really wish I could do combination experiment, but limited resources.. 

Today I also learned that when coffee is more mature to begin with (aka higher Brix), more pulp ends up in the fermentation tanks. 


<br><br>11/23/17
<br>Today we began to determine wash point with a mixture of pH and traditional knowledge. After 18.5 hours of fermentation, the pH of covered bucket =4, and pH open=5. Hilario said that even though pH was low enough for the covered, it still wasn’t ready because of touch (the miel didn’t come off easily). We waited 1.5 hours, then washed. 


As part of this blog, I want to show people what the culture is like in a coffee producing country. Everyday, Jose Juan and I travel the same route through the town of San Pedro Yepocapa (Insert hyperlink to wiki) I took a 10 min video of Yepocapa to show people where these coffee workers come from. Not having a gimble makes me realize how bumpy the road is!  In addition to the cobblestones, this town of 20,000 people has 20 speed bumps. 

There was ice on the volano this morning. Alfredo sent me photos. 


<br><br>11/29/17
<br>Newcomers on the finca! I’m not the only foreigner, though they still can’t call anyone else Gringo (it replaced my real name within a few days of my arrival). Japanese buyers from OCC have been here the past 2 days renewing a contract for Geisha (a pricey variety with a delicate taste). I accompanied they and an administrator to a tour of the mill. I translated to the one who spoke English. Seeing them marveling at the dozens of people squished into the back of a truck on the dirt road awakened memories of when I felt the same thing- witnessing many ridiculous and unsafe conditions of daily life. I realized how quickly I became accostumed to this culture- and once again, how humans are quite adaptable. 
On our tour, we spoke of how different things were in our respective countries. We also discussed how we would use more sterile methods if we were in charge. That night, I chatted with one of them while watching fuego erupt from our neatly trimmed lawn. 

We are about ready to cup our first samples! 
We have found, so far, that Lalcafe yeast is ready to wash after 18-21.5 hours
Covered buckets are ready to wash after 20 hours. Covering makes it anaerobic, so definitely changes the process. I still really wish I could ID the microbes, especially after talking to the Japanese guy at night while watching the volcano. He has a MS in Ecology and has used 96-well plates with microbial digestion to test soil diversity. He has no plate reader here, so just takes a photo- but it is still informative. More improper science in coffee land. He noted that this region has lower microbial diversity compared to Jamaica, no doubt due to the presence of volcanic ash here. 

<br><br>11/30/17
<br>Now that we really have our work schedule down, we are beginning multiple experiments each day. Today we began one that compared stirring the batch with a big wooden spade every 2 hours vs. not, as well as an experiment that compared no pulp ( control) vs. 5% pulp (1 lb) added vs. 5% pulp (1 lb) + lalcafe yeast added. 

I’m still keeping my eye on the flies. I partly hate them because they bite and their marks itch.. but they also inspire curiosity. Today, there are more flies around the covered only bucket. They can still definitely detect volatile chemicals emmited from the fermenting beans because it is not a totally sealed environment. 


<br><br>12/4/17
<br>Another newcomer! I’m now sharing my room with Jorge. He is here from Anacafe for a week. He specializes in post-harvest processes (like fermentation) and it’s great to have another person who actually knows how to manage experiments! 

Workers accidentally spilled water in the patio on one set of drying pergaminos. Not bad enough to re-do the experiment. I don’t worry about these improper science anymore. 

<br><br>12/11/17 
<br>Today I had the privilege of attending the cupping session of our samples at Anacafé. There are still many samples that are drying, and will be cupped after I leave Guatemala. I had attended a handful of informal cupping sessions at Bay Area cafes, but it was new to attend one that assigned formal scores that involved meticulous notes. Here is how it goes (attach cupping process photo). 
The cuppers are all professional Q graders (the highest certification) who cup many dozens of samples all day. They must follow a restricted diet around when they will cup- this includes no alcohol or tobacco. Here is a video of them in action. ( Attach video of cupping. )

<br><br>12/14/17
<br>My depature is looming and we are squeezing in the last of the experiments (mostly replicates of previous ones in an attempt to make the data a little stronger). When I leave, Jose Juan will fully take charge of monitoring the drying samples and ensuring their delivery to Anacafe after the holidays. He must also counting dry eans and record the data. I realized that no one else at the mill, besides maybe El colocho, would be able to do this. I realized I had no idea how many mill employees had attended high school, nor how many could read/ write. Data entry suddenly seemed more complicated- I had been taking my education partially for granted.
